Tomato Blight,"Tomato late blight shows dark, water-soaked lesions on leaves and fruit in cool, humid weather. Remove infected leaves, avoid overhead irrigation, ensure spacing, and spray a copper-based fungicide or chlorothalonil at label dose. Rotate crops; avoid planting tomatoes near potatoes."
Rice Cultivation,"Rice prefers warm temperatures (20–35°C) and flooded conditions during early growth. Maintain 2–5 cm standing water, apply nitrogen in split doses (basal, tillering, panicle initiation), and manage weeds with pre-emergent herbicide if needed."
Wheat Cultivation,"Wheat grows best in cooler climates with moderate irrigation. Irrigate at crown root initiation, tillering, booting, and grain filling stages. Use balanced NPK and seed treatment with fungicide to prevent smuts and rusts."
Maize Management,"Maize requires well-drained loamy soil and timely nitrogen top-dressing. Control fall armyworm using pheromone traps and, if severe, spray spinosad or emamectin as per label. Mulch to conserve moisture."
PM-Kisan Scheme,"PM-Kisan provides ₹6,000/year to eligible farmer families in three equal installments. Registration via PM-Kisan portal; Aadhaar, bank account, and land records required. Beneficiaries can check status online."
Soil Testing,"Test soil every 2–3 years to optimize fertilizer use. Collect representative samples (0–15 cm), dry and send to a soil lab. Use recommendations to target NPK and micronutrients; prevents overuse and saves cost."
Drip Irrigation,"Drip reduces water use by 30–50% and increases yield in horticulture. Place emitters near root zone, use filters to avoid clogging, and schedule irrigation in mornings/evenings."
Paddy Pest BPH,"Brown planthopper in paddy causes hopper burn and lodging. Maintain field sanitation, avoid excessive nitrogen, conserve natural predators; spray buprofezin if thresholds exceed."
Organic Pest Control,"Neem oil (0.5–1%) acts as antifeedant and repellent for soft-bodied insects. Use sticky traps for whiteflies and aphids; apply Bacillus thuringiensis for caterpillars."
Mandi Pricing Basics,"Mandi prices vary by market arrivals, quality, and season. Farmers can compare nearby markets to get better rates; grading and drying produce improves price realization."
Davangere Crops,"In Davanagere (Karnataka), major crops include paddy, maize, and cotton. Canal irrigation supports double cropping in some blocks."
